Minutes of meeting 31.01.2022	
•	Apologies – Geest and Witchill Poachers
•	Previous minutes read and passed
•	Team sheets issued – These have all the new dates for your fixtures and the website is updated to reflect the same. 
•	Action from previous meeting – dates for future meetings to be proposed by committee.
Suggestion is – to meet every other month, Wed 02 March 7pm Libs, Wed 04 May 7pm Libs, AGM Wed 13 July Libs. All cup dates are already drawn up to Mid April. At the May meeting the secretary will have all remaining cup draws together with dates for Jubilee Cup, Secretaries night, Presentation night etc. – This was agreed by the floor.
•	Outstanding games. Given the restrictions re Covid any games that have not been completed or an agreed date arranged (which can be at any point before the 10th June) by the 11th February the secretary will set dates and any team unable to play on the new date will forfeit. For scheduled games in the second half of the season, when the game is cancelled the secretary must be informed with an already agreed new fixture date. Failing which the secretary will identify a new date and any team unable to play will forfeit. 
•	Email received from British Rail which reads as follows:
Behaviour on the Alley - We would like to raise a general complaint about the behaviour of some opposition players watching while we are playing.
We have had various occasions when multiple players stay on the alley and have been talking which is off putting to our players. When asked to be quiet the responses have been quite flippant.
On occasion we have had to resort to ask their captain to sort it.
We feel that this unsporting behaviour is on the increase and would like the League to remind teams that players watching the other side should do that and not behave in an off putting manner. (Charmain to respond). – The secretary pointed out that common sense and a bit of etiquette should be used when other teams are rolling. The British Rail have followed the correct process to raise the issue and the committee have agreed that there should be nobody deliberately trying to put off opposing players or making unnecessary noise when an opposition player is rolling. Captains are responsible for monitoring the behaviour of their players. 
•	AOB – Secretary confirmed the final date for any outstanding games to be played as the 10 June.
•	Next meeting Wednesday 02 March 7pm in the Libs.
