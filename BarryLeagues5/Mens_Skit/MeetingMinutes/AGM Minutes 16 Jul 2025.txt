5. Matters arising
Fines for missed meetings - Entry fees will remain at £100, however as of this season we will be introducing a £5 fine per meeting for non attendance. Only 4 scheduled meeting dates (if extra called they will not be punishable by a fine). So a signing in form will be on the tables at each meeting next season. Your entry fee for the following year will then be based on the £100 fee plus any fines for missed meetings. (payable by the club themselves and not your pub if you are fortunate enough for your pub to pay your fees). Its only 4 meetings a year and anyone from your team can attend.  One team has withdrawn from last season, BP Breakaways. 3 New teams have been accepted  to join i) The Slammers ii) Libs Lobsters iii) Taking Liberties
6. One team withdrew during the season last year. Asdaholics. This leaves us with 33 teams. As such there will be 16 in Div 1 and 17 in Div 2.
7. Season will begin as always with Allform Cup Week Commencing 25 August. With the league beginning the week after. 

Next Meeting - Wednesday 20th August 7pm Libs
